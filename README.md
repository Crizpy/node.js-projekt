# node.js-projekt
This is a test projekt of me converting a old messy Node.js Application I wrote a few months ago into a stable and clean Application.

`npm install`

Then you have to adjust the configuration file not to use prod env, either to "dev" or to "local"

`node start.js`

If all done right it should work now under

`localhost:8081`
