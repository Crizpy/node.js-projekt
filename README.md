# node.js-projekt
This is a test projekt of me converting a old messy Node.js Application I wrote a few months ago into a stable and clean Application.

`npm install` -> Currently the package.json is not updated so you might have to install a few modules urself right now
if it says "module '?' not found" when trying to start it use "npm isntall ?" to install it repeat it until all modules are installed and until you can launch the application

Then you have to adjust the configuration file not to use prod env, either to "dev" or to "local"

`node start.js`

If all done right it should work now under

`localhost:8081`
